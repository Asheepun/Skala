Hello, <*name*>!
<br>
<br>
My name is Gustav Almstr√∂m and I'm soon releasing an indie puzzle game called Skala. Here's some quick info.
<br>
<br>
<b>Game:</b> Skala, a puzzle platformer where you can change the scale of yourself and the objects around you. You can make yourself large enough to step over a giant cliff, or make a key small enough to be passed through a solid wall. The game tries to explore the consequences of this rescaling mechanic through simple puzzles where you have to figure out how different objects relate to one another.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dev:</b> 19 years old and lives in Sweden. Studies theoretical physics and works on the game when not in school.
<br>
<br>
<b>Release:</b> Will release for free on Itch.io on April 27th.
