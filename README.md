# Skala

Skala is a puzzle game written C using my custom engine. The engine is built on Win32, Xlib, Opengl, and [miniaudio.h](https://miniaud.io/) and can be found in (lib/engine)[./lib/engine/] and (include/engine)[./include/engine].

Skala can be played for free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1884990/Skala/).
